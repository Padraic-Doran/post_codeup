I suppose this is mostly a journal for people/potential employers to read to understand what all I've done since codeup. My goal is to try to do several things everyday to continue to expand the skillset I have acquired. That being said, there might not be a whole lot that I can push to github. However, I intend to note what I worked on so that I can get my little green box of progress that seems to be the main virtue signal of being in the tech community. 

For those wondering, I took some time off to address my mental and physical health. If there is anyone from my old cohort reading this, I'm sure they'll have some sense of the strain that a job search can take on one's mental health. Anyways, I'll cut to the chase. My plan is to do stuff everyday and hopefully in the near future some company will think that I'm employable. 

#####Python
Learned how to use common features of pyPDF and rewrote from a lesson some functions that merge, split, and rotate pages of a pdf.
