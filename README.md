It's apparently important to be pushing to Github everyday to prove how much I like doing this stuff. I've wanted to focus on other things outside of pushing here everyday, but for appeasement's sake, I'll try to push work here every day. I suspect I'll just turn this readme into a journal of what I do everyday while work on datacamp and other websites that would probably prefer I don't publish answers. If this doesn't satisfy the concerns of hiring managers or other people wondering if I'd be a good fit in their organization, then I dunno, maybe talk to me or something. Seems like the human thing to do.
